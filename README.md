## Inspiration
We have started this project to help travelers around the world.
## What it does
This is a website made to help people know about Covid-19 cases in every country. Details of active cases, deaths, etc in every country are available on this website.

## How we built it
We built this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end and  Jquery, API, etc tools in back-end.
See the project here: https://and-rahul.github.io/CoviStat/

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we got through this process are collecting data of covid cases around the world. 
We made this possible using an Open API from the internet.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
When we started we don't know about APIs and we feel proud that we have tried making it with APIs.

## What we learned
We have learned about APIs in this process and mainly teamwork.

## What's next for CoviStat
CoviStat is made to help travelers regarding Covid cases around the places they travel. So, we will extend the data available by providing every state data of covid cases. And we will redesign the UI/UX.
